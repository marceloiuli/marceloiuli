Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello üëã I‚Äôm Marcelo Knox-Iuli, a full-stack software engineer and new graduate at General Assembly's SEI Bootcamp! I'm inquisitive about coding and I enjoy solving problems creatively and efficiently. Some of the languages I've worked with before include JavaScript, Python, and React. I also have experience working with the MERN stack and other database libraries as well. While I tend to spend most of my days coding, if I'm not by my computer I enjoy watching movies, spending time with my family and friends, and playing with my dog. 

üëÄ Here are some projects I've worked on ...

1. [War](https://github.com/marceloiuli/WAR) - A quick and fun card game based in luck that can be replayed on your browser

2. [SecretSafe](https://github.com/marceloiuli/Off-Your-Chest) - Developed a social media app where a user can post anonymously about anything they feel and the ability to control feedback

3. [SockX](https://github.com/marceloiuli/sockx) - Collaboratively designed an app where users can search and view posts on shoes with the intent to buy shoes from other users

4. [Abduct-Me](https://github.com/marceloiuli/abduct-me) - Created and developed an interactive app where users could book their own ‚ÄúAlien Abduction‚Äù
