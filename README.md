Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Marcelo Iuli, a full-stack software engineer and new graduate at General Assembly's SEI Bootcamp! I'm inquisitive about coding and I enjoy solving problems creatively and efficiently. Some of the languages I've worked with before include JavaScript, Python, and React. I also have experience working with the MERN stack and other database libraries as well. While I tend to spend most of my days coding, if I'm not by my computer I enjoy watching movies, spending time with my family and friends, and playing with my dog. 

ðŸ‘€ Here are some projects I've worked on ...

1.[War](https://github.com/marceloiuli/WAR)
2.[SecretSafe](https://github.com/marceloiuli/Off-Your-Chest)
3.[SockX](https://github.com/marceloiuli/sockx)
4.[Abduct-Me](https://github.com/marceloiuli/abduct-me)
